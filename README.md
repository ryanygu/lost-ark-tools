# Lost Ark Tools

Link (hosted on AWS): [http://3.20.66.121/](http://3.20.66.121/)

Pre-generated test account:

```

Lost Ark Tools was created as a way for me to get more familiar with designing applications from the ground up, and seeing how the different pieces fall in place. I have learned a lot from the different design choices I have made (both frontend and backend) and there are still features that I would like to explore in the future.

Note: Currently using a mock SMTP service via [Ethereal Email](http://ethereal.email) for quicker development. Emails for user registration will not actually be sent out but will be displayed in a virtual inbox. Will convert to a real SMTP service like [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) in the near future. Please use the provided login for now.


Will be able to do a live demo of user registration and an admin account upon request.

## Further work

- Redo authentication with an OAuth2 based provider like Auth0
- Refactor database to use a SQL based solution (MySQL + sequelize)
  - MongoDB was nice to get things up and running quickly, however, since there are so many features I am thinking about adding, a NoSQL solution is not the best way to go.
- Add a state management system like Redux Toolkit, or Zustand
  - Depending on how development goes, consider atomic models like Jotai
- Add a marketplace feature so I can implement a shopping cart and use Stripe for payments
- Finish configuring CI/CD pipeline
  - Automatic deployment after passing Jest unit tests
- Dockerize
- Set up SSL (Cloudflare or LetsEncrypt)
- Refactor from Bootstrap 5 to TailwindCSS
